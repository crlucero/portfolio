            </div>
              <div class="panel-body"><p> Hello, my name is Cristian Lucero! I was born in New Mexico and lived
           specifically in Albuquerque, NM a majority of my life up until September
           of 2018 when I moved to Seattle, Washington so that I could pursue a career in
           Web/App Development. I'm currently 23 years old and my goal is
           to land a job as a  Developer for companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p> I chose to enroll in a programming bootcamp after 4 years of traditional university.
            I changed my major from Exercise Science to Computer Science and immediately fell in love 
            with programming. It was hard but very interesting and chose to take a step towards making it my career.
            Although, when I switched majors, my graduation date was push back about 2.5 years and I did not want 
            to wait any longer to jump into a career in tech. So, I chose to fully immerse myself in Computer Science
            and applied to Epicodus.</p>

            <p>Basketball was my first love. I loved and worked at it so much that I had the opportunity to 
            play at the college level. After I quit playing, I chose to get into coaching and got a job 
            coaching the JV Boys Basketball team at the high school I attended, Manzano High School, where I 
            began to bleed <span style="color:purple">purple</span>!</p>
            
            <p>I also have a dog named Tom Brady that I love to take on walks, hikes, and car rides.</p>
